13. Build system: making stuff via dependencies
    makefile: You need a file called a makefile to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefile tells make how to compile and link a program.
    makefile syntax:
    targets: prerequisities
      commands
      commands
      commands
    target are filenames seperated by spaces.
    prerequisites are also file names
    run on cmd: `make`

example:

```
hello:
	echo "Hello, World"
	echo "This line will print if the file hello does not exist."
```


14. [weights and biases]
   used for ml experiment tracking, dataset versionning, project collab.
